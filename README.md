# Storytelling-trump

## Information

## Data

    We got our data from http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/

## Data Treatment

    We treated our data for the cloud word. What we essentialy did is to analyse all Trump's tweet and created a structure where each word is map to an integer representing the occurence of the word.
    then, after a sort on the structure, we kept only the word with an occurence greater than 3 times. For the cloud, we selected the 250 most often used words and created a cloud with them.
